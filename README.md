# Hugging_Face

This HTML website functions as an image classifier, smoothly integrating with the Hugging Face API. Upon the page's initial load, users are greeted with a prominent "Hugging Face" heading and two fields: one for image selection and another for file uploads. The primary purpose for users is to upload an image for species identification.

Optimized for compatibility with Google Chrome, the HTML form includes two additional fields: an image upload and a text field. In the script, the Hugging Face API's URL is embedded, streamlining data retrieval via the POST method. Token authorization, a key element pre-configured on the Hugging Face platform, is implemented for secure API access.

The API call, combined with the Hugging Face token, seamlessly integrates into the website, ensuring precise data retrieval and enhancing the image classification process. The development of this user-friendly website was influenced by insights from various YouTube tutorials. A variety of video resources were consulted to incorporate diverse suggestions and concepts, refining and optimizing the overall user experience.
